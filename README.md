This project analyzes customer sentiment and predicts buying behavior in the airline industry through web scraping and sentiment analysis, enabling targeted marketing strategies for improved customer satisfaction and retention. The classification models developed facilitate informed decision-making based on customer reviews of British Airways.

## Project Goal
The primary objective of this project is to analyze customer sentiment and predict buying behavior in the airline industry. By scraping customer reviews from the airlinequality.com website, we gather unstructured data specifically related to British Airways. Through sentiment analysis, we categorize these reviews as positive or negative, providing valuable insights into customer sentiment towards British Airways. Additionally, we build classification models using Random Forest and XGBoost classifiers to predict customer buying behavior, allowing for informed decision-making in marketing and customer retention strategies.

## Project Overview
The project follows the following key steps:

*Web Scraping*: We utilize web scraping techniques to extract customer reviews from the airlinequality.com website. Focusing specifically on British Airways, we gather unstructured data that serves as the basis for our analysis.

*Sentiment Analysis*: Leveraging natural language processing techniques, we perform sentiment analysis on the extracted customer reviews. By categorizing the reviews as positive or negative, we gain insights into customer sentiment towards British Airways. This analysis provides a foundation for understanding customer satisfaction levels.

*Classification Models*: To predict customer buying behavior, we build classification models using Random Forest and XGBoost classifiers. By training these models on a labeled dataset, we aim to accurately classify customers as potential buyers or non-buyers. These models facilitate targeted marketing strategies and enable informed decision-making.

## Results
The project successfully analyzes customer sentiment in British Airways reviews and develops classification models to predict customer buying behavior. The sentiment analysis provides insights into customer satisfaction levels, allowing for a better understanding of areas that require improvement. The trained classification models (Random Forest and XGBoost) facilitate targeted marketing strategies and informed decision-making in marketing and customer retention strategies.
